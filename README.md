# GroupCart

### Project Description

GroupCart is a platform that allows friends and families to easily coordinate and plan group purchases. With our app, users can sign up and create their own groups, where they can invite other members to join. Once a member is part of a group, they can view and contribute to the group's shared wishlist. Anyone in the group can add items to the wishlist, and anyone can purchase items from the list. This makes it easy for everyone to see what items are being considered for purchase, and who has already purchased each item.
